 * Client deadline for one /api/voice/transcribe request, in milliseconds.

 * A request the backend or proxy accepts but never settles is the one failure
 * the catch below cannot see — nothing rejects, so the promise stays pending
 * forever and the mic never leaves 'transcribing', the state that disables the
 * button the user would tap to retry or exit. So the fetch carries its own
 * deadline.
 *
 * The value sits between the two timeouts that bracket it: comfortably ABOVE
 * the backend's own speech timeout (60s read + 10s connect), so a slow but
 * living upstream always wins the race and reports its own 502 rather than
 * being cut off by the client, and far BELOW the ~300s nginx ceiling, so the
 * give-up is always this deadline rather than a socket dying under us. Same
 * value and same shape as the vendored tts.ts SPEAK_DEADLINE_MS — one voice
 * deadline, not two.
