"""Speech layer: STT + TTS via the shared workspace speech service.

PCC's implementation of the fleet voice contract (``../agent-standard/voice.md``;
chess is the reference). Speaches (STT) and Kokoro-FastAPI (TTS) both speak
the OpenAI audio API, so — like the llama.cpp provider — the client is two
POSTs over plain httpx, no SDK: ``/audio/transcriptions`` (multipart) and
``/audio/speech`` (JSON → mp3). The response body is validated by a Pydantic
wire model at the boundary; failures raise typed errors, never best-effort
parses. The httpx clients are injected in tests (``httpx.MockTransport``), so
live audio models never run in the suite.
