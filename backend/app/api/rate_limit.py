"""In-process per-IP rate limiting, exposed as a FastAPI dependency factory.

A tiny sliding-window limiter attached to a route via ``Depends(rate_limit(...))``.
No route uses it right now (the model-calling endpoints it guarded were removed
with the AI subsystem), but it is retained deliberately: the Phase 2 local-agent
endpoints will want to cap runaway work, and the limiter is the intended tool.

Deliberately dependency-free and process-local: this is a single-process,
single-user, local-first app, so a shared (Redis-backed) limiter would be
overkill. If the app ever scales to multiple workers, swap the in-memory
``_HITS`` store for a shared backend behind the same ``rate_limit`` factory.
