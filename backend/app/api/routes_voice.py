"""Voice API: STT/TTS proxies to the shared workspace speech service.

The browser posts audio here and gets text back (``/voice/transcribe``), or
posts text and gets mp3 back (``/voice/speak``); the transcript then goes
down the exact same ``/agent`` pipeline as typed input — voice never gets its
own path to the data. Both endpoints are rate-limited per client IP like the
agent surface, answer 503 when no speech service is configured, and 502 when
the upstream fails. Nothing here touches the database.
