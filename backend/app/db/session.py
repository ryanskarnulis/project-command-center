    - ``foreign_keys = ON``: SQLite ignores foreign keys unless this is issued on
      each connection, so orphaned FKs persist silently without it.
    - ``journal_mode = WAL``: the default rollback journal blocks readers during
      any write; WAL lets concurrent clients read while a write is in flight
      without "database is locked" errors. Persistent, but cheap to re-issue.
    - ``busy_timeout``: when two writers do collide, wait for the lock instead of
      failing immediately.

    Gated on the dialect so it stays correct if ``database_url`` is ever
    non-SQLite. NullPool (below) opens a connection per checkout, so these run
    per request — all three are fast no-ops once set.
